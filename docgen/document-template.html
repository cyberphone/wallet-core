${introduction}
This document describes the core components of the Saturn wallet.
Note that Saturn is a <i>payment authorization </i> system for end-users,
not a payment system.  Saturn is heavily influenced by the current
&quot;gold&nbsp;standard&quot; for consumer payments, ${href.emv}.
<p style='padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom:0'>
Compared to EMV, Saturn introduces several enhancements:
</p>
<ul style='padding-top:0;margin-top:0'>
  <li style='padding-top:0.5em'>For privacy reasons user authorizations are <i>encrypted</i>.</li>
  <li>Intended to work with <i>any</i> account-based payment system.</li>
  <li>Eliminates specific on-line solutions like 3D Secure.</li>
  <li>Receipt option.</li>
  <li>Account balance option.</li>
  <li>Built-in support for authorization of non-direct payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Saturn builds on the idea that different payment networks should not
need unique user authorizations solutions; only identifiers
related to accounts and payment networks need to be adapted.
This data is provided in the associated virtual payment cards (payment credentials),
potentially making the wallet software <i>universal</i>.
</p>
The sequence diagram below outlines the Saturn protocol: 
<div class='webpkifloat'><img src='sequence-diagram.png' class='webpkibox' style='width:50em' title='Sequence Diagram'></div>
${detailed-operation}
To guide the reader, this document is based on an example which
in turn provides links to the formal definitions.
<p>
The Saturn protocol is based on CBOR [${href.rfc8949}] which is a <i>binary</i> interchange format.
However, for documentation purposes, messages are shown in <i>diagnostic notation</i>.
</p>
To support cryptographic operations requiring secure transformations of CBOR <code>map</code> objects,
Saturn relies on an IETF standard in development [${href.cde}],
which defines <i>deterministic encoding</i> of CBOR.
${wallet-initiation}
The payment process is initiated when the <code class='entity'>Payer</code> hits a &quot;Pay&quot;
button on the Web or scans a QR-code, returning a <code class='entity'>Wallet</code> activation URL.
The <code class='entity'>Wallet</code> should then use the received URL for performing an HTTP&nbsp;GET
(step #1 in the sequence diagram) to the <code class='entity'>Payee</code> service.
This operation should return an ${href.authorization-request} object
(step #2 in the sequence diagram) like the following:
${authz-req.txt}
Note that the <code class='entity'>Payee</code> service <b>must</b> set the
HTTP <code style='white-space:nowrap'>Content-Type</code> to <code>application/cbor</code>.
${wallet-request-ui}
After receival of the ${href.authorization-request},
the <code class='entity'>Wallet</code> should display a UI like the following:
<div class='webpkifloat'><img src='wallet-ui.svg' style='padding:0;width:28em' class='webpkibox'  title='Wallet UI'></div>
If the <code class='entity'>Wallet</code> contains multiple 
${href.payment-credentials}
matching the <code class='entity'>Payee</code>
request, the <code class='entity'>Payer</code> needs
to select (step #3 in the sequence diagram) a suitable
credential, unless the default (or last used) credential already meet
the preferences of the <code class='entity'>Payer</code>.
<p>
If there are no matching payment credentials, the <code class='entity'>Wallet</code>
<b>must</b> provide the <code class='entity'>Payer</code> with
a suitable error message and a cancel button. 
</p>
${payer-authorization}
Assuming that the <code class='entity'>Payer</code> accepts and subsequently authorizes 
the request (step #4 in the sequence diagram),
the <code class='entity'>Wallet</code> should perform an HTTP&nbsp;POST
(step #5 in the sequence diagram)
to the <code class='entity'>Payee</code> service containing an
${href.authorization-response}
object like the following: 
${authz-res.txt}
Note that the POST <b>must</b> be directed to the same URL as
used by the GET in ${href.wallet-initiation}.
In addition, the HTTP <code style='white-space:nowrap'>Content-Type</code>
<b>must</b> be set to <code>application/cbor</code>.
${wallet-termination}
After successful (or failed) authorization, the 
${href.authorization-response}
should return a <code class='entity'>Wallet</code> termination
message (step #6 in the sequence diagram).
This message depends on how the payment process was initiated,
and is currently TBD.
${message-reference}
This section contains a reference to the components underpinning Saturn messages.
The components are based on CBOR <code>map</code> objects.
${authorization-request}
${authorization-response}
${pass-through-data}
${payment-request}
${service-provider}
${signed-authorization}
${payment-credentials}
A fundamental part of the <code class='entity'>Wallet</code> is a local database holding
enrolled payment credentials.
Note that although credential data types are expressed as CBOR,
other representations may be used.
The only requirement is that credential data types can be securely
mapped back and forth to CBOR.
<p style='margin-bottom:0.5em;padding-bottom:0'>
Each entry in the database contains a payment credential according
to the following definition:
</p>
${payment-credential}
${authorization-processing}
This section describes how
${href.authorization-response} messages
should be processed, using the ${href.payer-authorization} sample and
associated ${href.test-vectors} as model data.
${decryption}
Firstly, the ${href.authorization-response}
object needs to be <i>decrypted</i> using a private key associated with the 
supplied ${href.cef} <kbd>publicKey</kbd> or <kbd>keyId</kbd> attribute.
In the sample, a <kbd>publicKey</kbd> attribute was used.
The decryption process should return two CBOR objects:
the ${href.pass-through-data}
object which is supplied in clear:
${pass-through-data.txt}
and another object which after decryption should read like the following:
${restored.txt}
${signature-validation}
Now combine the objects retrieved during the decryption phase
by copying the first object (${href.pass-through-data})
to a label <code>1</code> of the second object.
Note that the length of the resulting <code>map</code> object
<b>must</b> be updated to reflect the addition of an item.
This operation effectively <i>recreates</i> the ${href.signed-authorization} object:
${signed-authz.txt}
Since this object contains a ${href.csf} <kbd>publicKey</kbd>
attribute, it can be validated using &quot;as&nbsp;is&quot;.
<p>
Note that the <i>authenticity</i> of received public keys <b>must</b>
be verified <i>before</i> authorization objects are acted upon!
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, authorization objects <b>must</b> also
be checked for alignment with the specification.
Missing, additional, or malformed elements <b>must</b> be rejected.
</p>
${test-vectors}
Equipped with an appropriate diagnostic notation parser like
<a href='https://cyberphone.github.io/CBOR.js/doc/playground.html'>
https://cyberphone.github.io/CBOR.js/doc/playground.html
</a> and ${href.cef}/${href.csf} support, the ${href.payer-authorization} sample
should be possible to decrypt and validate, using the following sample keys.
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Authorization key in JWK format:</div>
${authorization-key.jwk}
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Authorization key in COSE format:</div>
${authorization-key.txt}
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Encryption key in JWK format:</div>
${encryption-key.jwk}
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Encryption key in COSE format:</div>
