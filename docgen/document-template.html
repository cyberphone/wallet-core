<h3 style="text-align:center;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em">Saturn - Payment Authorization Wallet</h3>
<i>Disclaimer: this is a specification in an early state, subject to change without notice.</i>
<h3 id='introduction'>1.&nbsp; Introduction</h3>
This document describes the core components of the Saturn wallet.
Note that Saturn is a <i>payment authorization </i> system for end-users,
not a payment system.  Saturn is heavily influenced by the current
&quot;gold&nbsp;standard&quot; for consumer payments, ${href.emv}.
<p style='padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom:0'>
Compared to EMV, Saturn introduces several enhancements:
</p>
<ul style='padding-top:0;margin-top:0'>
  <li style='padding-top:0.5em'>For privacy reasons user authorizations are <i>encrypted</i>.</li>
  <li>Intended to work with <i>any</i> account based payment system.</li>
  <li>Eliminates specific on-line solutions like 3D Secure.</li>
  <li>Receipt option.</li>
  <li>Account balance option.</li>
  <li>Built-in support for authorization of non-direct payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Saturn builds on the idea that different payment networks should not
need unique user authorizations solutions; only identifiers
related to accounts and payment networks need to be adapted.
This data is provided in the associated virtual payment cards (payment credentials),
making the wallet software <i>universal</i>.
</p>
The sequence diagram below outlines the Saturn protocol: 
<div class='webpkifloat'><img src='sequence-diagram.png' class='webpkibox' style='width:50em' title='Sequence Diagram'></div>
<h3 id='operation'>2.&nbsp; Detailed Operation</h3>
To guide the reader, operation is described based on an example which
in turn provides links to the formal definitions.
<p>
The Saturn protocol is based on CBOR [${href.rfc8949}] which is a <i>binary</i> interchange format.
However, for documentation purposes, messages are shown in <i>diagnostic notation</i>.
</p>
<h5 id='initation'>2.1.&nbsp; Initiation</h5>
The payment proccess is initiated when the Payer hits a &quot;Pay&quot;
button on the Web or scans a QR-code, causing the wallet to perfom a HTTP&nbsp;GET
(step #1 in the sequence diagram) to the Payee service.  This returns a <a href='#authorization-request'>Authorization Request</a>
(step #2 in the sequence diagram) like the following:
${authz-req.txt}
<h5 id='wallet-request-ui'>2.2.&nbsp; Wallet Request UI</h5>
After receival of the <a href='#authorization-request'>Authorization Request</a>,
the wallet should display a UI like the following:
<div class='webpkifloat'><img src='wallet-ui.svg' style='padding:0;width:25em' class='webpkibox'  title='Wallet UI'></div>
If the wallet contains multiple 
<a href='#payment-credentials'>Payment&nbsp;Credentials</a>
matching the Payee
request, the Payer needs to select (step #3 in the sequence diagram) a suitable
credential, unless the default (or last used) is deamed suitable.
<h5 id='payer-authorizes-the-request'>2.3.&nbsp; Payer Authorizes the Request</h5>
Assuming that the Payer accepts and subsequently authorizes 
(step #4 in the sequence diagram) the request,
the wallet will perform a HTTP&nbsp;POST (step #5 in the sequence diagram)
to the Payee service containing an
<a href='#authorization-response'>Authorization Response</a>
object like the following: 
${authz-res.txt}
<h5 id='wallet-termination'>2.4.&nbsp; Wallet Termination</h5>
After successful (or failed) authorization, the 
<a href='#authorization-response'>Authorization Response</a>
should return a message (step #6 in the sequence diagram).
This message depends on how the payment process was initiated,
and is yet to be specified.
<h3 id='reference'>3.&nbsp; Reference</h3>
This section contains a reference to the components underpinning Saturn messages.
The components are based on CBOR <code>map</code> objects.
${authorization-request}
${authorization-response}
${pass-through}
${payment-request}
${service-provider}
${signed-authorization}
<h3 id='payment-credentials'>4.&nbsp; Payment Credentials</h3>
A fundamental part of the wallet is a local database holding
enrolled payment credentials.
Note that although credentials herein are expressed as CBOR,
other representations may be used.
The only requirement is that credential attributes can be securely
mapped back and forth to CBOR.
<p style='margin-bottom:0.5em;padding-bottom:0'>
Each entry in the database contains a payment credential according
to the following definition:
</p>
${payment-credential}
<h3 id='authorization-processing'>5.&nbsp; Authorization Processing</h3>
This section describes how
<a href='#authorization-response'>Authorization&nbsp;Response</a> messages
should be processed, using the
<a href='#authz-res.txt'>Sample&nbsp;Object</a>  and
<a href="#test-vectors">Test Vectors</a>.
<h5>5.1.&nbsp; Decryption</h5>
Firstly the <a href='#authorization-response'>Authorization&nbsp;Response</a>
object needs to be <i>decrypted</i> using a private key associated with the 
supplied ${href.cef} <kbd>publicKey</kbd> or <kbd>keyId</kbd> attribute.
In the sample, a <kbd>publicKey</kbd> attribute was used.
The decryption process should return two CBOR objects:
the <a href='#patj-through'>&quot;Path Through&quot;Information</a>
object which is supplied in clear:
${pass-through.txt}
and another object which after decryption should read like the following:
${restored.txt}
<h5>5.2.&nbsp; Validation</h5>
By simply combining the objects retrived during the decryption phase,
the <a href='#signed-authorization'>Signed&nbsp;Authorization</a> object is recreated:
${signed-authz.txt}
Since this object contains a ${href.csf} <kbd>publicKey</kbd>
attribute, it can be validated using &quot;as&nbsp;is&quot;.
<p>
Note that the <i>trust</i> in a received public key <b>must</b>
be verified <i>before</i> the authorization object is used!
</p>
<h3 id='test-vectors'>6.&nbsp; Test Vectors</h3>
Equipped with an appropriate diagnostic notation parser like
<a href='https://cyberphone.github.io/CBOR.js/doc/playground.html'>
https://cyberphone.github.io/CBOR.js/doc/playground.html
</a> and ${href.cef}/${href.csf} support, the <a href='#authz-res.txt'>Sample Authorization</a>
should be possible to decrypt and verify, using the following sample keys.
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Authorization key in JWK format:</div>
${authorization-key.jwk}
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Authorization key in COSE format:</div>
${authorization-key.txt}
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Encryption key in JWK format:</div>
${encryption-key.jwk}
<div style='margin-top:0.8em'>Encryption key in COSE format:</div>
${encryption-key.txt}
